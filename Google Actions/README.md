### Pros

1. Powerful voice recognition

2. Available in android, IOS & Google Home (multiplatform)

3. Dialogflow integration available without any fuss

### Cons

1. Does not give user email id information

2. Has a max. 5 second timeout for all responses

3. You cannot give multiple responses for 1 single request. Hence, response can only be triggered and follows a simple request-response pattern which is undesirable in many cases where trigger need not be from user.

4. Understanding errors - Talk to pizza bot becomes talk to pizza hut

5. Some buttons/cards are still not available
