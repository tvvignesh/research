2. Provides separate credentials for development for free
3. Rich ecosystem and not just limited to SMS & Voice
4. Studio available to design interactive flows without much programming
5. Very good customer base - https://customers.twilio.com/

### Cons

1. Speech to Text conversion is not accurate and there is no option currently to use a third party plugin like Google Voice to do the recognition or speak out.
2. Its costlier compared to other services but it offers the quality for the price.
3. India numbers not available (at the time of writing this) and this is an issue since we have to make ISD calls during development & testing.
